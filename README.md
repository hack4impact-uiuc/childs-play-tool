# Theraputic Video Game Guide

This is a digital version of the Theraputic Video Game Guide found here: http://childsplaycharity.org/assets/downloads/booklet.pdf

The purpose of this guide is to recommend therapeutic video games for children based on their symptoms. The games recommended in this guide were curated by researchers at EEDAR, a market-leading video game research firm, in collaboration with mental health researchers at UCSD. Game recommendations have been categorized into six symptom categories:

› Pain   
› Boredom (Short-Term Stay)   
› Boredom (Long-Term Stay)   
› Anxiety/Hyperactivity   
› Sadness   
› Cognitive Impairment

This guide was designed as a quick reference to help caretakers quickly select games for their patients. Caretakers can reference the category that best fits the symptoms of the patient and select one of the games listed. When selecting an appropriate game, the user should first select the appropriate symptom and age category of the child, and then select a title based on the available gaming platforms at the facility. Note: Virtual Reality Games are currently not recommended by the manufacturer for children under the age of 12
